This means that for every 8 loaves of bread sold, 3 are whole wheat and 5 are white bread.\nSince they sold 150 loaves of bread, we can divide 150 by 8 to find the number of sets of 8 loaves sold: 150 / 8 = 18.75\nSince we can't sell a fraction of a loaf, we'll round down to 18 sets of 8 loaves sold.\nThis means they sold 18 * 3 = 54 loaves of whole wheat bread\n#### 54"}

{"question": "Maria is planning a road trip from New York to Los Angeles. The distance between the two cities is 2,796 miles, and she wants to drive at an average speed of 40 miles per hour. However, she needs to stop every 300 miles to rest and refuel. How many hours will it take Maria to complete her trip?", "answer": "To find the total driving time, we first need to calculate the total driving distance. Since Maria stops every 300 miles, we can calculate the number of stops she'll make by dividing the total distance by 300 miles: 2796 miles / 300 miles per stop = <<2796/300=9.32>>9.32 stops.\nSince she can't make a fraction of a stop, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. So, she'll make 10 stops.\nNow, we can calculate the total driving time by dividing the total distance by her average speed: 2796 miles / 40 miles per hour = <<2796/40=69.9>>69.9 hours.\nSince she'll be stopped for 10 segments of 300 miles each, we add the time it takes to make those stops: 10 stops * 30 minutes per stop = <<10*30=300>>300 minutes or 5 hours.\nTherefore, the total trip time is 69.9 hours + 5 hours = <<69.9+5=74.9>>74.9 hours.\n#### 75 hours"}

This can be done by dividing the total distance by 200 miles: 840 miles / 200 miles per segment = <<840/200=4.2>>4.2 segments.\nSince we can't have a fraction of a segment, we'll round down to 4 segments.\nNow we can calculate the total time taken for the driving: 4 segments * 2 hours per segment = <<4*2=8>>8 hours.\nWe also need to add the time taken for the breaks. Since there will be 4 segments, there will be 3 breaks (one before the first segment, one between the first and second segments, one between the second and third segments, and one after the third segment). Each break takes 2 hours, so the total time taken for the breaks is 3 breaks * 2 hours per break = <<3*2=6>>6 hours.\nTherefore, the total time taken for the trip is 8 hours + 6 hours = <<8+6=14>>14 hours.\n#### 14"}

Then, the number of loaves of whole wheat bread sold is x + 120, and the number of loaves of rye bread sold is x + 240\nSince the total number of loaves sold is 480, we can set up the equation: x + (x + 120) + (x + 240) = 480\nSimplifying the equation, we get: 3x + 360 = 480\nSubtracting 360 from both sides, we get: 3x = 120\nDividing both sides by 3, we get: x = 40\nSo, the bakery sold 40 loaves of white bread, 40 + 120 = 160 loaves of whole wheat bread, and 40 + 240 = 280 loaves of rye bread\n#### 40 white, 160 whole wheat, 280 rye"}

Therefore, x = 4.\nThus, there are 4 employees in the front section and 11 employees in the back section.\n#### 4"}

If Ashley wants to put an equal number of boxes of each color in each bag, how many bags can she make in total?", "answer": "Since Ashley has 15 boxes in total, and she wants an equal number of boxes of each color, let's find the number of boxes per bag. We know that the total number of boxes is the sum of the boxes of each color: 15 = 3r + 5b + 2g, where r is the number of red boxes, b is the number of blue boxes, and g is the number of green boxes.\nTo find the number of boxes per bag, we can divide the total number of boxes by the number of colors (3): 15 \u00f7 3 = 5\nThis means Ashley can put 5 boxes of each color in each bag. Now, we can find the number of bags by dividing the total number of boxes of each color by the number of boxes per bag: r = 15 / 3 = 5, b = 15 / 5 = 3, g = 15 / 2 = 7.5 (we can't have a fraction of a box, so we'll round down to 7)\nSo, Ashley can make 5 red bags, 3 blue bags, and 7 green bags in total.

The company claims that the product will reduce energy consumption by an average of 20% and save customers $100 per year. However, some critics argue that the product's advanced algorithms may introduce a 5% error margin, which could lead to customers overpaying for the service. If the company offers a 2-year warranty and a 10% discount for customers who pay annually, how much might customers pay for the product over the 2-year period?", "answer": "First find the total cost without the discount: $100/year * 2 years = $<<100*2=200>>200\nThen find the discount amount: $200 * 10% = $<<200*10*.01=20>>20\nThen subtract the discount from the total cost: $200 - $20 = $<<200-20=180>>180\n#### 180"}

{"question": "A bakery sold 250 loaves of bread at $2.50 per loaf and 150 loaves of whole wheat bread at $3.00 per loaf. If they also sold 75 loaves of gluten-free bread at $2.00 per loaf, what was the total revenue from bread sales and how much profit did they make?", "answer": "The revenue from the regular bread is 250 * $2.50 = $<<250*2.5=625>>625.\nThe revenue from whole wheat bread is 150 * $3.00 = $<<150*3=450>>450.\nThe revenue from gluten-free bread is 75 * $2.00 = $<<75*2=150>>150.\nThus, the total revenue is $625 + $450 + $150 = $<<625+450+150=1225>>1225.\nTo calculate the profit, we need to subtract the cost of bread from the total revenue. Assuming the cost of bread is $1.00 per loaf, the cost of 250 regular loaves is 250 * $1.00 = $<<250*1=250>>250,\nthe cost of 150 whole wheat loaves is 150 * $1.00 = $<<150*1=150>>150,\nand the cost of 75 gluten-free loaves is 75 * $1.00 = $<<75*1=75>>75.\nThus, the total cost is $250 + $150 + $75 = $<<250+150+75=475>>475.\nTherefore, the profit is $1225 - $475 = $<<1225-475=750>>750.\n#### 750"}

She has three car options: a sedan that gets 30 miles per gallon, an SUV that gets 25 miles per gallon, and a truck that gets 20 miles per gallon. If the distance from city A to city B is 750 miles, how much more money will Lily save by choosing the most fuel-efficient option versus the least fuel-efficient option?", "answer": "To calculate the cost of gas for each car, we need to divide the total distance by the miles per gallon for each car.\nFor the sedan, the cost of gas would be 750 / 30 = 25 gallons.\nFor the SUV, the cost of gas would be 750 / 25 = 30 gallons.\nFor the truck, the cost of gas would be 750 / 20 = 37.5 gallons.\nSince Lily has a budget of 1200 dollars, she can afford to spend up to 1200 / 8 = 150 dollars per gallon.\nSince the sedan would cost 25 * 150 = 3750 dollars, which is more than her budget, it is not a viable option.\nSince the truck would cost 37.5 * 150 = 5625 dollars, which is more than her budget, it is also not a viable option.\nThis leaves the SUV as the only viable option, which would cost 30 * 150 = 4500 dollars.\nHowever, the question asks for the difference in cost between the most fuel-efficient option and the least fuel-efficient option, which is the sedan. Since the sedan would cost 3750 dollars, and Lily can only afford to spend up to 4500 dollars, the most fuel-efficient option (the SUV) is actually the most expensive option in this scenario.
