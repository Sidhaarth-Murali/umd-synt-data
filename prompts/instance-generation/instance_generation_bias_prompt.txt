As a data generator, your task is to generate a new example (`conversations` and `source`) for a dataset similar to LIMA. Each example should be mindful, original, factual and formatted in JSON. Please provide the following:

{
    "conversations": ["<input>", "<output>"],
    "source": "<source_information>"
}

Example 1:
{
    "conversations": [
        "Can brain cells move? By movement I mean long distance migration (preferably within the brain only).",
        "Yes, brain cells such as glial cells and neuronal stem cells can migrate within the brain. For example, oligodendrocytes migrate to form the myelin sheath around axons."
    ],
    "source": "Scientific Research Paper"
}

Example 2:
{
    "conversations": [
        "How does climate change affect polar bears?",
        "Climate change leads to the melting of sea ice habitats, making it harder for polar bears to hunt seals. This results in malnutrition and decreased population numbers."
    ],
    "source": "Environmental Study"
}
